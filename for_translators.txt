VampireInTrainingQuest:
Quest and reward make reference to the vanilla "Vampires(?)" event. If you can make this more interesting in another language, please do.
  in English relic description is necessary to avoid the "any card with 'Strike' in its name" tag. The relic transforms only starter Strikes.

PrioritiesQuest:
Sarcastic remark suggesting that something is being done in exactly the _wrong_ order due to malice or incompetence. Also takes the form of "but... priorities." Rename as you see fit.
Regarding "One at a time" in quest description: at this time, defeating two or more enemies in a single action will fail the quest. This might be changed in a future revision.

RapidImprovisationQuest:
Player is compelled to play 6-10 random cards in one combat, often at a disadvantage. Quest could have been named "MacGyver Quest" for similar effect.
You could also change the theme entirely if there's a clever insect metaphor available.
The name and description of "Ecdysis" should be on theme with "Metamorphosis" and "Chrysalis". Note that "Ecdysis" might sound foreign even to a native English speaker (it's not even in IntelliJ's dictionary).
